Need to clean up code -
Need to read from column for as long as its not null, instead
of hard coding it. 

Assuming you have connected the google docs api
this code reads from that file, one column is for the
emails the other is for in my case their passwords.
and sends them a personilized message with their email and
login password.

Additional columns can be added.
Depending on the task.

In order for the code to login to your gmail, you have to change your
email security settings.
